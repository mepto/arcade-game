Kawai frogger
=============

This is a new HTML/Javascript, freely interpreted version of Konami's Frogger game from 1981, made for Project 5 of UDacoty's FrontEnd nanodegree.

The aim of the game is to bring the player to the water for a refreshing swim, going around rocks, and avoiding collisions with bugs who will reset the player's location.

Each successful access to water increases the points count, each encounter with a bug reduces the number of lives of the player.

## How to access the game?

You can download the repository as a zip file and, once the files are extracted, open the "index.html" file. The page with the game will appear.

## How to play?

Use arrows to move the player.
Hit the Y key or the space bar on your keyboard to start the game.
Hit the P key to pause the game.
Hit P again or the space bar to resume when the game is paused.
